                I work with companies to get more value out of their websites.
                Some of the ways I have been able to help my clients out have been
                adding mailing lists, interactive menus, and appointment scheduling
                as well as adding an admin section to their website to allow user
                management, inventory tracking, and reporting.

                Here are a few ways I have been able to help:<br />

                When we look for development talent to augment our team, we are not just
                looking for coding capabilities - that is easy to find. We are looking for
                thinkers, problem solvers, people who understand our broader vision and
                will shoulder the load to help us reach our goal. We are interested in aligning
                ourselves with partners that understand what we are doing and will be there in
                lock step with us along the way. And that is what we have found with Mark Brown
                of Meshed Solutions - a partner that gets us, and gets what we're doing.
